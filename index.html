    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am a student researcher
      at Brigham Young University
      studying Chemical Engineering
      with a double minor in Computer
      Science and Spanish Language,
      and am seeking an internship
      in my field. My current research
      project consists of building
      thermodynamic models in Python
      and Star CCM+ to optimize heat
      transfer from an
      ultra-high-temperature
      nuclear reactor.
      Through my coursework and
      research opportunities I have
      developed both a specialty in
      and a love for all aspects of
      chemical engineering, and
      especially the development and
      use of computational models to
      solve real world problems
      in this field.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a
        thermodynamic model in Python
        to describe radiative heat
        transfer from a small modular
        nuclear reactor with an
        average running temperature
        of 2000 degrees centigrade
      .</li>
      <li>Built a compiler for the
        Datalog programming language
        in Microsoft Visual Studio
        using C++.</li>
      <li>Designed a control
        system for maintaining
        uniform CO2
        concentration for an
        industrial soda water
        carbonation operation.</li>
